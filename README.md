# My Python Journey

This repository is a collection of my daily Python practice problems, concepts, and small projects. As a MERN stack developer, I am expanding my toolkit to include Python to leverage its power in **AI/ML** and **Backend Microservices**.

## 📌 Goals
- [ ] Master Python Fundamentals (Operators, Loops, Functions)
- [ ] Build logic-based mini-projects
- [ ] Integrate Python AI models with MERN applications (Quantify Project)
- [ ] Transition into Python-based Backend roles (Django/FastAPI)

## 📂 Repository Structure
The code is organized by topics for easy navigation:

| Folder | Topic | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Operators/` | Assignment, Comparison, Arithmetic | ✅ Completed |
| `Conditionals/` | If-Else, Logical Operators | ⏳ In Progress |
| `Loops/` | For & While loops | 🔜 Planned |

## 🚀 How to Run
To run any of the scripts in this repo, ensure you have Python 3.x installed:

```bash
python Folder_Name/file_name.py
