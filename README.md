#  My Python Journey

This repository documents my learning journey with **Python**, focusing on building strong fundamentals, improving problem-solving skills, and writing clean, readable code.  
It serves as a personal learning log as well as a reference for Python concepts and practice programs.

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- Build a solid foundation in Python programming
- Practice logical thinking and problem solving
- Strengthen backend and scripting fundamentals
- Maintain a structured record of my Python learning progress
- Gradually convert practice exercises into small, usable projects

## 🛠️ Skills & Concepts Covered

- Python syntax and fundamentals
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions and modular programming
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling (introductory level)
- Debugging and logical problem solving

🚀 Mini Projects (In Progress / Planned)

Number Guessing Game

Simple Calculator

Contact Book (CLI-based)

Text Analyzer

Task Manager (Command Line)

These projects are intended to apply Python concepts to practical, real-world style problems.

▶️ How to Run the Code

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jayalloyd/My-Python-Journey.git
```

Navigate into the repository:
```
cd My-Python-Journey
```

Run any Python file:python filename.py

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

📈 Learning Approach

Write code from scratch instead of copying solutions

Focus on understanding logic before optimization

Refactor and improve older programs regularly

Add comments for better readability and learning

Emphasize clarity and correctness over complexity
